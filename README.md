Started as a DIY to apply the obd unlock to the Gen1 and select Gen2 BMW iRoms instead of paying another company between 2-300.00 for something that takes less than 30 minutes. Initially created by O.S. Automotives, I have added the ability to read and display the current PRG (for using tunerpro), Identifies the engine code, Chassis, and displays the generation. it works for all Gen1/2 F&G series up until June 2020.

**>>>> THIS WILL NOT READ THE DME, YOU MUST ALREADY HAVE A BENCH READ TOOL THAT CAN READ AND WRITE THE iRom/BIN FILE TO THE DME<<<<**

To use, download the python script and run from your desktop, once the program opens, select "load bin"-->"patch bin"-->"save bin as". write modified bin back to the DME. it si also packeaged into a .exe file so you can run it straight from your desktop without the need to install python.
